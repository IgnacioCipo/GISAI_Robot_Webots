# GISAI_Robot_Webots

In this repo we will develop the Webots simulation of the robot constructed in the GISAI group in order to develop reinforcement learning. 


In the branch "SimplifiedSimulation" we will be developing a simplified simulation, so we can test the reinforcement model faster. 
At this day we have:
- Base robot with two wheels and the two motors.
- 1 distance sensor at the front.
